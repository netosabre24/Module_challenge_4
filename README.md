# Module challenge 4

#Overview of district analysis
In this project, the goal was to analyze data on student funding classes and average/passing test scores
to show schools individual performances and rank them among different catagories.

#Results
Total Students
* The data adjustment affected 9th grade scores but did not remove them from the data count 
of total students at the schools,

Total Budget
* Budget value remained the same and was unaffected by the data changes of student scores, therefore the budgets of the schools
remained the same
 
Average Scores of math and reading
* When the 9th grade scores were removed, there was a slight change within the math score that made it drop by %.1 As for the reading
scores remained unaffected

Percentage of students passing math scores
* The passing math scores only dropped by a %.2 with the data adjustment

Percentage of students passing reading scores
* The passing reading scores only dropped by a %.3 percent with the data adjustment

Overall percentage of Students passing math & reading
* The overall passing of both reading and math was only dropped by %.1 with the data adjustment of 9th grade scores being removed and replaced with NaN

#Summary
Overall from the analysis of this project, scores didnt drop more than 3/10 when implented data changes of removing scores of a whole grade (9th) and replaved with NaN. This can be very useful when needing to filter grades to determine specific pools of data.
